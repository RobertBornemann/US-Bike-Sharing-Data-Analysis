# US-Bike-Sharing-Analysis

In this project, I am using data provided by Motivate (https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I am comparing the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

This data app runs with streamlit on Python 3.8. The following libraries are required to run the project:

* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* Counter
* sys
