# US-Bike-Sharing-Analysis

In this project, I am using data provided by Motivate (https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. It is an interactive streamlit data app that allows you to compare usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

This data app runs with streamlit on Python 3.8. The following libraries are required to run the project:

* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* Counter
* sys

You can start the app on a localhost using: `streamlit run bike_sharing_data_ui.py`
